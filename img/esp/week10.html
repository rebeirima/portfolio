<br>
<h3>What is the ESP32 Wroom?</h3>
<p>The ESP-WROOM-32 is a powerful, generic WiFi-BT-BLE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications ranging from low-power sensor networks to 
    the most demanding tasks such as voice encoding, music streaming and MP3 decoding.</p>
<h3>Creating the board in Eagle</h3>
<p>Before creating the board in eagle, I read the datasheet for the ESP-WROOM-32 to help me understand the layout of the module better. I also drew out the circuit to make the Eagle process easier and faster.</p>

<h3>Making the Board Using the Other Mill</h3>

<h2>Programming the Board</h2>
<p>I had issues when programming my board. The first problem was when I first ran Neils code to make sure my board was working with working code, my chip could not even be connected.
    To make sure it wasn't a hardware problem, I checked my Eagle schematic to make sure every that needed to be connected is connected. I realised I didn't connect ground to one of the resistors so I added a wire to connect it to where it
    needed to go. After I did that, I ran the code again and this time it was able to find me board but it would always tell me the error "Brownout detector was triggered". After asking Anthony's help, Anthony wasn't able to find anything wrong with my
    board and concluded there must be a problem with the ESP-32 chip that I had. However, since there weren't anymore chips available and Anthony didn't order anymore, I wasn't able to replace the chip on my board
    and get a working board.
